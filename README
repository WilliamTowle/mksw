mksw
====


Overview
--------

  'mksw' is a Makefile-based build system intended to aid building one
or more related packages, eg. to create a toolchain suitable for
generating further packages. Configuration files for a number of
packages (plus dependencies) are provided as a starting point, with
files they include forming a framework for adding more.

  In order to work in a consistent manner regardless of the choice of
software to be built, a top level Makefile is provided which contains
a 'help' rule (to report status) and which acquires additional build
rules through an 'include' directive. Once an initial configuration
file has been specified [from among files in the Config tree, through
the CONFIG environment variable], all necessary build rules and
associated help text become available through the main Makefile.


Build Stages/Mechanism
----------------------

  While configuration files for 'mksw' can be written to work wholly
independently, it is anticipated that typical include files will fall
broadly into one of two types:
	1) those containing general build rules, and
	2) those containing package configuration.
  Files provided for the first of these include rules for downloading
and extracting source code, and can be found under the Config/INCLUDE
tree. Files for the second can be found in the other assorted
directory trees under Config/.

  The framework of build rules in these files aims to allow more
complicated builds to progress through some or all of the following
stages:
	1) adding any necessary packages to the host system;
	2) creating a native toolchain for building packages;
	3) adding a natively-hosted toolchain for cross compilation;
	4) building and preparing packages for some target system,
where related build rules can be found in:
	Config/INCLUDE/build-native-userland.mk
	Config/INCLUDE/build-cross-userland.mk
	Config/INCLUDE/build-native-toolchain.mk
	Config/INCLUDE/build-common.mk
	Config/INCLUDE/build-cross-toolchain.mk
