* covered
- EeePC and network booting
- cross compilation of kernel and userland; initial ramdisks
- audio (ALSA)
- graphics (DirectFB, shim, FBZX)
- Perl, and Perl Power Tools
- Dropbear, udhcpc/udhcpd, remote CLI by openSSH
- ncurses: in Python, lynx (pkg-config), n2048 (ncurses5-config)

* ST - misc
- explanation of container_of()
- see misc/hbOS/about-links.html (with backref to 'lynx')
- 'DirectFB': interesting if we assume replacement kernels less buggy?
- directVNC, if we can get sane 800x480 resolution to work

* LT
- X11: do we *need* wchar and locales (stock Ubuntu vs custom Debian)
- directvnc: did we point it at sane libraries? use suitable DirectFB?
- portlx builds for ARM; can we export local NFS root into QEmu?
- QEmu: -net nic... and ...connect, ...listen (? no outside world)
