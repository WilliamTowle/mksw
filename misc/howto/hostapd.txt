1. Check support
	Run `/sbin/iw list` first
Want to see see "* AP" under "Supported interface modes:"

Another way: `lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i 'network'` tells me "Kernel driver
in use: ath9k", for which `/sbin/modinfo ath9k | grep 'depend'` lists
"ath9k_hw,mac80211,ath9k_common,cfg80211,ath" ...and having seen
'mac80211', be happy.

2. Initial system configuration and minimal config

...this is sufficient to fire up the daemon and troubleshoot any
issues with related system configuration.

* /etc/network/interfaces needed the following, to ensure that
wpa_supplicant wasn't running:
	auto wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet static
	address		192.168.42.253
	network		192.168.42.0
	netmask		255.255.255.0
	broadcast	192.168.42.255

hostapd-test.conf contained
	interface=wlan0
	driver=nl80211
	ssid=test
	channel=1

	$ sudo ./misc/alsalibs.sh ./toolchain/usr/bin/hostapd hostapd-test.conf 

wills@pixie:/mnt/sda9/devel/mksw-160216$ sudo ./misc/alsalibs.sh ./toolchain/usr/bin/hostapd hostapd-test.conf 
Configuration file: hostapd-test.conf
Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 1c:4b:d6:f2:59:1b and ssid "test"
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED 


3. Serving addresses

For this step, you will need dnsmasq running. I've got a similar
configuration to my initial experiment with it
https://dunedlin.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/dnsmasq-on-a-debian-server/
but with "interface=wlan0"

##	=====
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=APNAME
channel=1

# auth_algs:
# bit 0 = Open System Authentication
# bit 1 = Shared Key Authentication (requires WEP)
auth_algs=1
channel=1
#wpa: which WPA implementation to use
#1 - wpa only
#2 - wpa2 only
#3 - both
wpa=3
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=APKEY
macaddr_acl=0
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

* Other steps

Your client will need wpa_supplicant.conf to have an appropriate
entry as created by `wpa_passphrase APNAME APKEY`

...you should then see the remote machine acquire an address, and be
able to ping the server from it (and vice versa)

- /etc/default/dnsmasq has "ENABLED=1"
- /etc/default/hostapd to set DAEMON_CONF to /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf to run hostapd permanently
- also iptables - see https://dunedlin.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/dnsmasq-and-iptables-to-lan-and-beyond/
