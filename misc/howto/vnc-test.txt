TODO: cover 'screen' first? Work with making it build under hbOS?

From: http://gpio.kaltpost.de/?page_id=84

Requires the packages xvfb, x11vnc, ratpoison, xterm
Recommends reinstallation of xfonts-base

Server start - :1 if X11 already running; by
default "only screen 0 exists and has the dimensions 1280x1024x8":
	Xvfb :0 -screen 0 800x600 -ac
Without reinstall of xfonts-base, there are "Could not init font path
element" messages (TODO: reinstall and revisit this? seems to work
without...)

WM start:
	DISPLAY=:1 ratpoison &

Article continues with remote connection over ssh which runs x11vnc.
From the same machine, we can observe our second window manager
with:
	x11vnc -localhost -display :1
	vncviewer localhost:5900
From a remote machine with ssh port forwarding, run x11vnc as the
appropriate user with:
	ssh -l kaltpost -L 5900:localhost:5900 kaltpost.de 'x11vnc -localhost -display :0'

Useful controls:
	ctrl-T c	create new session (ie. xterm window)
	ctrl-T ?	help

Note that killing the vncview window will cause the x11vnc server to exit
(TODO: ...because the default behaviour is one-shot mode?)
