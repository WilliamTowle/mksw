For this article, I have chosen to discuss the 'screen' utility
http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
which I have recently been installing in my live Debian images
https://dunedlin.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/debian-a-live-usb-primer/

screen v4.0.3 can also be buit under my homebrew distribution (if appropriately
patched
http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/app-misc/screen/files/
), but the utilities for reading the battery aren't ready yet

|ncurses-5.9
|screen-4.0.3 ... or screen-4.2.1?

|Configure needs to locate the ncurses headers (** iffy)
|		CFLAGS='-I'/var/tmp/mksw-temp/toolchain'/usr/include' \
|		LDFLAGS='-L'/var/tmp/mksw-temp/toolchain'/usr/lib' \
|		./configure \
|			--prefix=/var/tmp/mksw-temp/toolchain/usr \
|			|| exit 1 ;\

|
|Simply build and install:
|		make \
|		make install \
|
|
|Run:
|	./toolchain/usr/bin/screen
|Fails because:
|	No more PTYs
