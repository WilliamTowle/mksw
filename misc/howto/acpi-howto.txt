'acpi' - Reading Laptop Battery Status

To date, my homebrew linux OS has had a

kernel configured without power management,
in keeping with the resulting build being tested under emulation more
often than not.

Lately I have had cause to read the battery status on a real machine.
With a suitably-compiled kernel (acpi support via CONFIG_ACPI
http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/ACPI.html
), it is possible to examine the /sys/class subdirectory 'power_supply'
and query the kernel directly.

For a slightly more user-friendly approach, enter the 'acpi' utility,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi/
which does this on one's behalf.

Preparation
The 'acpi' suite requires your kernel to be configured with (at least)
the options:
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_AC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY=y

Building
For this step use the usual configure/make/make install sequence, with
./configure --prefix=... if necessary.

Checking Statistics:
'acpi' can query a variety of statistics including thermal and
cooling information, and can get the relevant numbers from /proc if
this is more relevant to your kernel. By default, it echoes battery
status as reported under /sys, thus:

${TOOLCHAIN}/usr/bin/acpi
Battery 0: Full, 100%

...today I'm connected to the mains and my battery is fully charged :)
